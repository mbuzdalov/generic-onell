/**
  * This trait represents a contiguous integer distribution.
  *
  * It provides methods `minValue` and `maxValue`, which define a range for integers this distribution may provide.
  * Sampling is done using the `sample(rng: Random)` method, which returns one `Int` at a time.
  *
  * The design constraint is that each of the values between `minValue` and `maxValue` may be produced
  * with nonzero mathematical probability (but it may have a zero computer probability, for instance if
  * the mathematical probability cannot be represented as a nonzero `Double`, or if the random number generator
  * that is passed to `sample` is especially weak). So if `minValue > maxValue`, each call to `sample` fails.
